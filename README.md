# Global Financial Performance & Marketing ROI Audit 💰📈

## 📝 Context & Objective
This project focuses on auditing the financial efficiency of marketing investments across six key international markets: **USA, Australia, UK, Germany, France, and Canada**. The goal was to determine if high advertising spend correlates with high profitability and to identify opportunities for budget optimization.

## 🛠 Methodology
### Technical Stack
- **Tools:** SQL (PostgreSQL), Microsoft Excel (Financial Modeling).
- **Key Metrics:** Gross Profit, Margin %, ROI (Return on Investment).

### Executive Overview of the Process
1. **Data Consolidation:** Used SQL to aggregate revenue, operational costs, and campaign expenses.
2. **Profitability Analysis:** Calculated the **ROI_pct** for each territory to measure the effectiveness of every dollar spent on advertising.
3. **Comparative Audit:** Normalized financial data to compare performance between markets with vastly different scales of operation.

## 📊 Findings (Key Insights)
- **Efficiency Leader:** The **United States** market is the top performer, achieving the highest Gross Profit ($1.45M) with a remarkable **ROI of 75.7%**.
- **The European Paradox:** The **UK, Germany, and France** show a worrying trend. They have the highest campaign costs (each exceeding $2.2M) but the lowest ROI (between 18% and 22%).
- **Diminishing Returns:** Increasing the ad spend in saturated markets (Europe) does not lead to proportional profit growth, suggesting a need for a strategy pivot.

## 💡 Business Recommendations (CFI)
1. **Strategic Budget Reallocation:** Reallocate a percentage of the marketing budget from low-ROI markets (Canada and France) to the **United States** to maximize global net utility without increasing the total budget.
2. **Market Audit:** Conduct a deep dive into the UK and German markets to understand why they require such high investments ($2.2M+) to generate lower profits. 
3. **Efficiency Over Volume:** Focus on improving the quality of conversion in European markets rather than increasing the volume of ad spend.
